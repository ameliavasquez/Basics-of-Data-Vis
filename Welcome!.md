## On the Site Creator 
All that is is political. <br /> <br />
Since childhood, the political knowledge I picked up from those around me—knowledge on environmental pollution, suffering, systemic domination, 
and State inaction—came together to construct my core motivations and ultimately who I am today. I became determined at a young age to do what I could to improve the
lives of as many people as I could. 
<br /> <br /> Throughout middle and high school, I developed my political understandings in activities like policy debate, in which I roleplayed
as a policymaker alongside my peers to produce impactful legislation relating to national issues and foreign policy issues. Now, in college, I am continuing my
political science and policy-oriented education. Most importantly, I now know how I want to use my capabilities to make meaninful differences: policy research. I work 
as a policy research aide at my university, where I have had the opportunity to learn statistical analysis and coding skills that help me contribute to major research
projects covering topics such as COVID-19 infection rates by state and race, infant mortality and natality rates by race and year, SNAP food insecurity rates before 
and during the pandemic, etc. <br /> <br />
 In the future, I hope to build a career around policy research that not only covers topics important to me, but that is used by 
legislators and their committees for crafting majorly transformative policies.

## Site Motivation
My current education and career goals have led me to develop my policy research skills, which among other things include coding and data visualization. This site
serves as a collection of data vis information I learn, data visualizations I have gathered from the internet, and data visualizations I have created. Join me on this
10-week journey as I improve upon my data vis knowledge and capabilities!
