## Political Participation and Unhappy Constituents 
<br />

### Section 1: Politics, Optics, and the News


It’s no secret that the American public holds deep rooted disdain and distrust for their elected representatives and public officials. 

<br />

Elections, referendums, and other acts of political participation become wildly hot topics in our current political climate, 
a political climate riddled with strife between parties and friction between representatives and their constituents. 
What is more, individuals are becoming increasingly disenchanted with the two-party system that is dominated by seemingly ineffective and unmalleable parties. 
In August of this year, the 
[Pew Research Center](https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2022/08/09/as-partisan-hostility-grows-signs-of-frustration-with-the-two-party-system/?utm_source=AdaptiveMailer&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=8-9-22%20Parties%20and%20Partisanship%20GEN%20DISTRO&org=982&lvl=100&ite=10316&lea=2168337&ctr=0&par=1&trk=a0D3j000011cufqEAA) 
calculated that since 1994, the proportion of voters who have an unfavorable opinion of both major political parties has increased fourfold—rising from 
6% to 27% of voters in less than 30 years. 

<br />

The Pew Research Center’s recent study also found that young voters are much more dissatisfied with the modern political system than older voters. 
While not a shocking finding, this trend has consequential implications for our political leaders. Older individuals are more easily placated with good optics, 
ie. the appearance of effectiveness, efficiency, and a genuine concern with the greater collective. This doesn’t cut it for Millennial and Gen Z voters. 

<br />

Growing up throughout unprecedented national tragedies, economic downturns, and political gridlock regarding life-or-death issues, young constituents 
expect more from who they elect. What is now demanded is less optics and more action. Yet, the effect of this development on current political participation 
must be further studied in order to reestablish the relationship between elected officials and the public, and more importantly, to reconstruct the role that 
the people hold in the political sphere. 


<br />

### Section 2: On the Data Source
In order to explore this question of political participation in the midst of growing dissatisfaction with the current political regime, 
I sourced polling data from the American National Election Studies (ANES). This data reflects survey responses of 8280 individuals taken 
both before and after the 2020 Election. 
<br />

The ANES has been a trustworthy and reliable source of polling data regarding political public opinion and electoral 
behavior since the mid-twentieth century. This data is consistently high quality, non-partisan, and substantial in its breadth 
of variables available for analysis.

 <br />

The 2020 Time Series Study which I pull my information from is the most current release of the study, embedded with the most current 
processing, cleaning, and key documentation. Due to pandemic precautions, this survey was conducted using a mixed-mode and contactless 
design, which included live online video interviews, telephone interviews, and self-administered online surveys. 
The sample was based on the 231 million adult citizens residing within the United States. Potential participants were 
chosen based on a random draw from lists of residential addresses where mail is delivered, and eligibility relied on the 
participant’s residence at the sampled address as well as their being an adult U.S. citizen at the time of recruitment.
Those randomly selected residences were sent mail invitations to participate, and respondents completed a pre-election survey as well as a post-election survey. 

 <br />

This data is not without limitations, however. It is composed of 8280 respondents, a relatively small number in comparison 
to the significantly larger population it is attempting to gauge. This means there are concerns with how well the sample actually 
reflects the behavior and opinion of the broader public. Additionally, this is compounded by the pandemic-era methods used. Since 
respondents were required to participate either fully or partially online, there is the potential that older, less up-to-date voters 
were somewhat crowded out of the process. Moreover, 10.0 percent of those who responded to the pre-election survey did not participate 
in the post-election survey, suggesting that the sample post-election could have become even more skewed relative to the broader population 
than previously assumed for the pre-election survey. 

<br />

### Section 3: The Issue of Failing Politicians and the Resolution of Doomerism

The 2020 Election was both catastrophically overwhelming and disappointingly underwhelming. Unless you were a far-right MAGA-head or a center-left Establishment Democrat, then you were probably not too thrilled with either presidential party nominee. Yet, the matters that dominated the considerations of voters were monumental in significance and consequence: COVID-19, climate change, increasingly murky relations with Global Superpowers, precariously protected social rights, and more. This combination of lackluster candidates and high stakes issues only exacerbated the dissatisfaction felt by voters over the last few decades. 

<br />

In order to better measure public opinion regarding the presidential nominees in relation to its effect on voter participation, I created histograms that showcased presidential nominee feeling thermometer data alongside data on the voting behavior of survey respondents. Feeling thermometer values ranged from 0-100, with 0 representing a strong negative opinion of the nominee, 50 representing a neutral opinion of them, and 100 representing a strong positive opinion of them. See below for the corresponding graphs of the major party nominees: Biden and Trump. 

<br />

![graph2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/91711083/198229847-f0063c22-6d81-4809-827a-30b6e35fa9f4.jpeg)


<br />

I gathered a few points from these histograms. First, it is immediately evident that, across the board, survey respondents were more likely to hold a very negative view of Trump than of Biden, with the feeling thermometer data on Biden showing a much more equal distribution of values. Second, those who did not vote tended to hold more varied views on Trump, whereas their opinion of Biden was more heavily concentrated on values of neutrality. In general, respondents tended to show more neutral or more positive opinions of Biden than of Trump. 

<br />

Another interesting conclusion that could be drawn from this visualization is that those who voted held stronger opinions in general than those who did not vote. Visually, it is clear that the graphs for those who voted have distributions that tend toward the extremes of the x-axis in comparison to the more equally spread-out distributions of the graphs featuring respondents who did not vote. This indicates that the strength of one’s opinion, either for or against a candidate, is a significant driver of voting behavior. In other words, those who are the most passionate are those who are the most mobilized. 

<br />

Below are similar feeling thermometer histograms but instead with data on opinions toward the Supreme Court and Congress. 

<br />

![graph3](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/91711083/198229875-6db1fd26-6014-4318-a65b-9f81b8e3e6e5.jpeg)



<br />

Evaluating both sets of histograms in conjunction, it seems as though the respondents held significantly more neutral opinions of the Supreme Court and Congress than of either presidential nominee. This finding seems to be reflective of the way in which our political system and media sources place particular emphasis on the President in comparison to the Judiciary and Legislature. As a singular elected official who is in charge of an entire branch of government (and who has significant reign over the other two branches), the role of the president can certainly appear to trump the Supreme Court and Congress, especially when coverage of the 2020 election focused so heavily on the election of a president rather than equally on the various offices up for election. This observation and analysis of media coverage could suggest that voters tend to vote because they care more about the outcome of the presidential election, which they have stronger views of, instead of voting because of an equal concern for all elections, or a greater concern for legislative outcomes. 

<br />

Another observation of note pertaining to this graph is that respondents of all voting behaviors held more positive opinions of the Supreme Court than of Congress. Perhaps this could be because, at the time, the Supreme Court was less sensationalized and less openly politicized that Congress was. The public may have also had less knowledge of the work done by the Supreme Court, and thus fewer strong opinions on controversial rulings since more people simply did not know about them. In 2020, significant Supreme Court controversies were mostly wrapped up in events involving the nomination of problematic judges such as Brett Kavanaugh, but even this example was related intensely back to the Congress who approved him and the President who nominated him. Thus, the Supreme Court appears to be more isolated from the public, and not a particular driver of voter turnout in elections. This visualization and the corresponding analysis could be improved with more information pertaining to the main reasons that were noted by people who didn’t vote for not voting. 

<br />

I was also interested in the apathy voters held for the federal government. As a proxy for apathy, I used data on people’s opinion toward the prompt: the government doesn’t care about public opinion. For this variable, 1 stood for strongly agree, 2 was somewhat agree, 3 was a neutral opinion, 4 was somewhat disagree, and 5 was strongly disagree. I was particularly interested in analyzing this apathy across party identification and ages of survey respondents. See below for the resulting graphs.  

<br />

![graph1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/91711083/198229798-eed4ffd3-be7e-408f-abfa-c21a246c559d.jpeg)

<br />

As you can see in the plot above, survey respondents across all parties and ages had a strong tendency to believe that the government does not care about public opinion. However, it is important to note that this visualization cannot account for the fact that the data may be skewed to prefer respondents who are younger, more tech savvy, and thus who share similar, up-to-date opinions on the responsiveness of the government. Despite this, the overwhelming trend toward apathy seen in all parties still suggests that this is not an observation that should be overlooked. This widespread apathy reflects the ‘doomerism’ mentality that voters are increasingly developing. 

<br />

When the issues facing you are so dire, and the elected officials who are meant to respond to them are so insufficient, it is easy to feel as though you and your fellow Americans are doomed, with no ability to save yourselves nor any opportunity to be saved by those in power. 

<br />

Compellingly, there is a noticeable difference in the democrat plot than that of the other parties. While the majority of democrats do not believe the government cares about public opinion, there is a not-insignificant number of democrats who somewhat believe that the government cares. Further research aside from mine should evaluate if this observation correlates with a larger amount of political participation among democrats. 

<br />

While I did not study political participation across the different parties, I did want to examine various forms of political participation in relation to other forms of apathy. This measure of apathy was based on the prompt: I have no say in what the government does. The values for this variable were as follows: 1 is strongly agree, 2 is somewhat agree, 3 is neutral, 4 is somewhat disagree, and 5 is strongly disagree. I analyzed this form of apathy by evaluating its correlation with various kinds of political participation: contacting one’s representative, joining a political demonstration, or attending a political meeting, all within the last year. For these variables, a value of 2 represented having done so, and 1 represented not doing those activities in the past twelve months. See the resulting plots below:

<br />


![plot5](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/91711083/198229893-5f7efe8c-2125-4497-a217-fbd5707b671b.jpeg)

![plot6](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/91711083/198229910-4de410c4-80b8-46f7-bdde-58c02761ce40.jpeg) 

![plot7](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/91711083/198229921-246a7a11-6491-4ef2-b52a-67cb1b6ee21c.jpeg)

<br /> 

These graphs would be greatly improved upon by using a visualization format that is more suited to showcasing the correlation between two discrete variables, and by successfully adding the necessary labels directly onto the graphs. Additionally, for those reasons, it may be hard for someone to immediately recognize the trends that are being described in the graphs. 

<br /> 

In all three, a particular trend can be observed: as one increasingly believes that they do have a say in the government, they tend to not attend a political meeting, not participate in a political demonstration, and not contact their representative. The opposite can also be said. When someone thinks that they have less say in what the government does, they tend to participate more in those forms of direct political action. 

<br /> 

While the correlation coefficients appear to be relatively small on the graph, they are not insignificant in practice. Those correlations have a profound implication: that the growing apathy, the growing negative opinions toward politics and political actors, does not lead people into never-ending cycles of doomerism and pessimism. Rather, those who are most angry with the political system are those who will probably be those who radically transform it for the better. Not only can this be seen in the recent election data, but it is reflected throughout history. Major revolutions and transformative eras have been borne from those who shouted the loudest and fought back the hardest. 

<br /> 

Rather than being a source of mere concern, the growing trend of political dissatisfaction among voters can be seen as a source of hope as well.
