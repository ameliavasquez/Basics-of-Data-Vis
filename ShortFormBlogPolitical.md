## Political Participation and Unhappy Constituents 
<br />

### Section 1: Politics, Optics, and the News


It’s no secret that the American public holds deep rooted disdain and distrust for their elected representatives and public officials. 

<br />

Elections, referendums, and other acts of political participation become wildly hot topics in our current political climate, 
a political climate riddled with strife between parties and friction between representatives and their constituents. 
What is more, individuals are becoming increasingly disenchanted with the two-party system that is dominated by seemingly ineffective and unmalleable parties. 
In August of this year, the 
[Pew Research Center](https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2022/08/09/as-partisan-hostility-grows-signs-of-frustration-with-the-two-party-system/?utm_source=AdaptiveMailer&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=8-9-22%20Parties%20and%20Partisanship%20GEN%20DISTRO&org=982&lvl=100&ite=10316&lea=2168337&ctr=0&par=1&trk=a0D3j000011cufqEAA) 
calculated that since 1994, the proportion of voters who have an unfavorable opinion of both major political parties has increased fourfold—rising from 
6% to 27% of voters in less than 30 years. 

<br />

The Pew Research Center’s recent study also found that young voters are much more dissatisfied with the modern political system than older voters. 
While not a shocking finding, this trend has consequential implications for our political leaders. Older individuals are more easily placated with good optics, 
ie. the appearance of effectiveness, efficiency, and a genuine concern with the greater collective. This doesn’t cut it for Millennial and Gen Z voters. 

<br />

Growing up throughout unprecedented national tragedies, economic downturns, and political gridlock regarding life-or-death issues, young constituents 
expect more from who they elect. What is now demanded is less optics and more action. Yet, the effect of this development on current political participation 
must be further studied in order to reestablish the relationship between elected officials and the public, and more importantly, to reconstruct the role that 
the people hold in the political sphere.

### Section 2: On the Data Source
In order to explore this question of political participation in the midst of growing dissatisfaction with the current political regime, 
I sourced polling data from the American National Election Studies (ANES). This data reflects survey responses of 8280 individuals taken 
both before and after the 2020 Election. 
<br />

The ANES has been a trustworthy and reliable source of polling data regarding political public opinion and electoral 
behavior since the mid-twentieth century. This data is consistently high quality, non-partisan, and substantial in its breadth 
of variables available for analysis.

 <br />

The 2020 Time Series Study which I pull my information from is the most current release of the study, embedded with the most current 
processing, cleaning, and key documentation. Due to pandemic precautions, this survey was conducted using a mixed-mode and contactless 
design, which included live online video interviews, telephone interviews, and self-administered online surveys. 
The sample was based on the 231 million adult citizens residing within the United States. Potential participants were 
chosen based on a random draw from lists of residential addresses where mail is delivered, and eligibility relied on the 
participant’s residence at the sampled address as well as their being an adult U.S. citizen at the time of recruitment.
Those randomly selected residences were sent mail invitations to participate, and respondents completed a pre-election survey as well as a post-election survey. 

 <br />

This data is not without limitations, however. It is composed of 8280 respondents, a relatively small number in comparison 
to the significantly larger population it is attempting to gauge. This means there are concerns with how well the sample actually 
reflects the behavior and opinion of the broader public. Additionally, this is compounded by the pandemic-era methods used. Since 
respondents were required to participate either fully or partially online, there is the potential that older, less up-to-date voters 
were somewhat crowded out of the process. Moreover, 10.0 percent of those who responded to the pre-election survey did not participate 
in the post-election survey, suggesting that the sample post-election could have become even more skewed relative to the broader population 
than previously assumed for the pre-election survey.
